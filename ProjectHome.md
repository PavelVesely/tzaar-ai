Tzaar is a 2-player board game from Project GIPF.

The main part of the project is the robot for playing Tzaar written in C. There is also a HTTP client for communicating with Boiteajeux.net (in Python), a client for [Daedalus Game Manager](http://code.google.com/p/daedalus-game-manager/) (in C#) and a set of test positions obtained from games on Boiteajeux.net.
