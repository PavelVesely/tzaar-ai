 *
 * Description: The Control interface is optionally implemented in conjunction
 * with IGameLogic, to provide support for the Control GameMessage.   It allows
 * Control messages to be handled directly by the game logic, bypassing the
 * server.  The logic uses the callback delegate to send data to either client
 * in response to a Control message.
